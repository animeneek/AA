# 🩺 AA – AI-Assisted Health (Demo)

AA is a simple web-based telehealth demo that allows users to log in, describe their symptoms via a simulated AI chat interface, and connect with available doctors — all through a clean, responsive UI built with **Tailwind CSS** and **GitHub Pages**.

This is a **frontend-only demo** built entirely with HTML and TailwindCSS, with no backend or JavaScript logic. It is suitable as a prototype for showcasing layout and flow.
